> To find signals in data, we must learn to reduce the noise—not just the noise that resides in the data, but also the noise that resides in us. It is nearly impossible for noisy minds to perceive anything but noise in data.

## General info

Experiments in linguistics and psychology often produce **time-varying signals** that are only poorly approximated by popular statistical techniques, such as linear regression. Recent developments in statistical modelling provide solutions to this issue, enabling more nuanced and powerful statistical analysis. This workshop will be led by two researchers who are experts in dynamic data analysis. It will familiarise participants with the conceptual underpinnings of two analytical approaches, **General Additive Mixed Modelling** and **Functional Data Analysis**, providing hands-on training on how to implement the analyses in the statistical package `R`. It will bolster the participants' research profiles by expanding their methodological toolkit, and by embedding them in a network of early career researchers from neighbouring disciplines.
