## General info

Experiments in linguistics and psychology often produce **time-varying signals** that are only poorly approximated by popular statistical techniques, such as linear regression. Recent developments in statistical modelling provide solutions to this issue, enabling more nuanced and powerful statistical analysis. This workshop will be led by two researchers who are experts in dynamic data analysis. It will familiarise participants with the conceptual underpinnings of two analytical approaches, **General Additive Mixed Modelling** and **Functional Data Analysis**, providing hands-on training on how to implement the analyses in the statistical package `R`. It will bolster the participants' research profiles by expanding their methodological toolkit, and by embedding them in a network of early career researchers from neighbouring disciplines.

## Speakers [ADD PICTURES]

Dr **Márton Sóskuthy** is a lecturer in phonetics and phonology in the Department of Language and Linguistic Science at the University of York.
His main interests are sound change, phonetics and phonology, and their interactions. He uses computational simulations and statistical modelling to approach questions in these areas.

Dr **Michele Gubian** is a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Experimental Psychology at the University of Bristol and soon he will be joining the Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing at LMU Munich as a postdoctoral researcher. He has worked across a variety fields, from smart sensor design to psycholinguistics, keeping a focus on the methodological aspect of research. His major contribution has been the introduction, development and popularisation of techniques from Functional Data Analysis in the domain of phonetics, especially for the analysis of intonation and prosody.
