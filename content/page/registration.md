## Who can apply

We welcome researchers in Linguistics and Psychology. PhD students and early career researchers are particularly encouraged to attend. Students and unaffiliated researchers will benefit from a reduced registration fee.

The workshop will require some degree of background in R and statistical analysis. Experience with linear mixed effects regression would be beneficial for the GAMM part, while general knowledge of Principal Component Analysis and basic calculus (the concepts of derivative and of definite integral) would be beneficial (but not essential) for the FDA part. Please bring your own laptop.

The workshop will feature clinic sessions, in which participants will carry out hands-on analysis using the data from their peers. Help from the speakers will be available. Please bring your own data!
