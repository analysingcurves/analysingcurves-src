<img src="../images/marton.jpg" width=150 align="right" hspace=10/> Dr **Márton Sóskuthy** is a lecturer in phonetics and phonology in the Department of Language and Linguistic Science at the University of York.
His main interests are sound change, phonetics and phonology, and their interactions. He uses computational simulations and statistical modelling to approach questions in these areas.

<img src="../images/michele.jpg" width=150 align="right" hspace=10/> Dr **Michele Gubian** is a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Experimental Psychology at the University of Bristol and soon he will be joining the Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing at LMU Munich as a postdoctoral researcher. He has worked across a variety fields, from smart sensor design to psycholinguistics, keeping a focus on the methodological aspect of research. His major contribution has been the introduction, development and popularisation of techniques from Functional Data Analysis in the domain of phonetics, especially for the analysis of intonation and prosody.
